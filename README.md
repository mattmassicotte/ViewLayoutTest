# ViewLayoutTest
Test for auto layout-based animations with CoreAnimation

The core issue is my inability to animate layout changes when a containing view is layer-backed. I have, more or less, implemented the animation I'd like in LayoutAnimationViewController. However, as soon as I set wantsLayer to true, the animation no longer occurs.
